## Setup

To setup a new Entropia project, run the following command:

```sh
ent new
```

This will prompt you for:
- The name of the project
- The display name
- Which emit type to use (bin / c / no)

The file `Entropia.lua` will be created

```lua
-- Entropia.lua
-- Configuration file for project "demo"
-- Generated by the Entropia Programming Language

project "demo"
    display "Demo Project"
    config "default"
        output "bin"
```

## Configurations

If you need to, you can then add another config, for example:
```sh
ent config add fast
```

```sh
ent flag set output no --config test
```

```lua
...
project "demo"
    ...
    config "test"
        output "no"
```
## Dependencies

### Add

To add a dependence to your project, use the `deps add` command:

#### Official

To add an official dependence, just use its name.

In this example, we will add the `lua` package

```sh
ent deps add lua
```

This will edit your config file:

```lua
...
project "demo"
    ...
    deps { "lua" }
    ...
```

#### Local

To add a local dependence, use the **relative** path to its config file.

Example using the `../locdep` project as the dependence.


```sh
ent deps add ../locdep/
```

```lua
...
project "demo"
    ...
    deps { "../locdep/" }
    ...
```

#### Remote

To add a remote dependence, use the following command:
```sh
ent deps add github.com/<user>/<repo>
```

### Remove

To remove a dependence, use the `deps remove` command:
```sh
ent deps remove locdep
```
## Run

To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
ent run
```

## Test

To run the tests (`*.entest` files), use the `test` command:

```sh
ent test <file / *>
```
# Flags
## Emit
### Effect

Switch the type of output of the compiler.

- `bin` means the code will be compiled to an executable
- `no` means the code will be interpreted
- `c` means the code will be transpiled into C

### Default

Compile to an executable (`bin`)

### Command

To switch to `no` / `asm` / `c` emitting, use one of these commands:

```sh
ent flag set emit no
ent flag set emit asm
ent flag set emit c
```

## Watch

To watch a file and re-run the code when the file is saved.
```sh
ent run --watch
```
OR
```
ent run -w
```
